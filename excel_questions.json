        "expected_answer_description": "A **relative cell reference** (e.g., A1) changes when a formula is copied to other cells. For example, if `=A1+B1` is in C1 and copied to C2, it becomes `=A2+B2`. This is the default behavior and is useful when you want to apply the same logic to different rows or columns of data.\n\nAn **absolute cell reference** (e.g., $A$1) remains fixed when a formula is copied. The dollar signs lock the row and/or column. This is used when a formula needs to always refer to a specific cell, like a fixed exchange rate, a tax rate, or a constant value that shouldn't change when the formula is moved.",

Drag fields to the appropriate areas (Rows, Columns, Values, Filters).\n\n**Purpose of the 'Values' area:**\nThe 'Values' area is where you place numerical fields that you want to **summarize** or **aggregate** (e.g., sum, count, average, max, min). When you drag a field here, Excel automatically applies a default aggregation function (usually SUM for numbers, COUNT for text).

For example, looking up a product name (lookup value) in a product catalog (table array) to retrieve its price (column index number) or description.\n\n**VLOOKUP Limitations:**\n1.  **Left-to-Right Only:** It can only look up values in the leftmost column of the table array and return values from columns to its right. It cannot search to the left.\n2.  **Column Insertion/Deletion Issues:** If columns are inserted or deleted within the table array, the `col_index_num` argument needs to be manually updated, which can break formulas.\n3.  **Exact Match Default (implicit):** While it has `range_lookup`, many users inadvertently use approximate match or get confused, leading to incorrect results if exact match isn't explicitly specified.\n\n**Modern Function to Overcome Limitations:**\n**XLOOKUP** is the modern successor to VLOOKUP (and HLOOKUP). It overcomes VLOOKUP's limitations by:\n* **Bi-directional Search:** It can look up values to the left or right.\n* **No Column Index:** It uses separate `lookup_array` and `return_array` arguments, making it immune to column insertions/deletions.\n* **Exact Match Default:** Its default `match_mode` is exact match, reducing errors.\n* **Other features:** It also handles approximate matches, wildcard characters, searching in reverse, and returning an \"if not found\" value directly.",
